# Fizzled
Fizzled is a collection of fuzzing scripts. Which most of the time run but not find anything.

# mutilator.py
Creates Charlie Miller style random files and stores them in the samples directory.

# taskmaster.py
Picks up a samples from the samples directory.
Moves this to the work directory so other workers can't touch it.
Starts autopsy and moves to crash if autopsy wants this.

# Autopsy.py
Autopsy runs the program, and stores the data.

# Syslog
All programs use the logger for output, best to set this to syslog.
